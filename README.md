# JoJo Stand Name Mixer

Inspired by Alex Onsager's Pokemon Fusion, this app mixes two random stand names together.

Clicking on a Stand's picture will open the Wikia page in another tab.

You can choose to switch out the first or second part of the name for another one.

Beware of spoilers! Different Parts can be enabled by clicking on the switches. You can also enable special names such as The World, ACT1, ACT2, and more.

If you have any suggestions on how to improve this, feel free to contact me at prinphon@gmail.com!

Thanks for checking it out!
